# Regression-Practice-Problems
I was assigned and completed the practice problems for linear and logistic regression. The practice problems came from Harvard's CS109 lab section. See these link for the overall course description, linear regression lab, and logistic regression lab respectively: https://github.com/cs109, https://github.com/cs109/2015lab4, and https://github.com/cs109/2015lab5.
